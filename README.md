# Necta-Exam-Downloader
Script which downloads nectar past papers automatically
requirments-requests,bs4(Beautiful soup) and urllib.
I made this simple script since most of the time i fell its a real pain on the back when i have
to download manually from the website to get the pastpapers.
you can use this script on android also if use pydroid3 and install the packages required.
